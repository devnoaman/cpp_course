# C++ Short Hand If...Else (Ternary Operator)

The **ternary operator** is a shorthand way to write simple `if...else` statements. It allows you to evaluate a condition and execute one of two expressions based on whether the condition is `true` or `false`.

---

## Syntax
```cpp
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;
```

---

## Example: Using Ternary Operator
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int temperature = 30;
    string weather = (temperature > 25) ? "Hot" : "Cold";
    cout << "The weather is: " << weather;

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
The weather is: Hot
```

## Comparison with `if...else`

### Using `if...else`:
```cpp
int time = 20;
if (time < 18) {
    cout << "Good day.";
} else {
    cout << "Good evening.";
}
```

### Equivalent Ternary Operator:
```cpp
int time = 20;
string result = (time < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";
cout << result;
```

## Key Points
1. The ternary operator is concise and replaces simple `if...else` statements.
2. It is commonly used to assign a value to a variable based on a condition.
3. Use it for readability in straightforward conditions, but avoid overusing it for complex logic.
