### **Homework 1 (Alternative): Grocery Store Billing System (Structures, Loops, Arrays)**  
**Task:**  
Create a program to simulate a simple billing system for a grocery store. The program should:  
1. Allow the user to add up to 50 items available in the store, with details such as:  
   - Item Name  
   - Price per Unit  
   - Quantity in Stock  

2. Display the list of available items.  
3. Allow a customer to create a bill by purchasing items, where they specify:  
   - Item Name  
   - Quantity to purchase  

4. Calculate the total bill and update the stock quantities accordingly.  
5. Prevent the purchase if the requested quantity exceeds the stock.  

**Requirements:**  
- Use a `struct` to represent each item in the store.  
- Use an array to store multiple items.  
- Use loops for adding items, generating the bill, and updating stock.  
- Include input validation to ensure the user cannot purchase more than what is available.
