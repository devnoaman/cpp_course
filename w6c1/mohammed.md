### **Homework 2: Student Grades Management (OOP, Loops, Arrays)**  
**Task:**  
Create a program to manage student grades. The program should allow the user to:  
1. Add students and their grades for three subjects (Math, Science, English).  
2. Calculate and display the average grade for each student.  
3. Determine the student with the highest average grade.  

**Requirements:**  
- Use a class `Student` with the following attributes:  
  - Name  
  - Grades for three subjects  
  - Average grade  

- Implement the following methods in the `Student` class:  
  - A method to calculate the average grade.  
  - A method to display student details.  

- Use an array of `Student` objects to handle multiple students.  
- Use loops to iterate through the array for calculations.
