### **Homework 1: Library Management System (Structures, Loops, Arrays)**
**Task:**  
Create a program to manage a small library. The program should allow the user to:  
1. Add up to 100 books using an array of structures.
2. Each book should have the following details:  
   - Title  
   - Author  
   - Year of Publication  
   - ISBN Number  

3. Display the list of all books in the library.
4. Search for a book by its title.

**Requirements:**  
- Use a `struct` to represent a book.  
- Use an array to store multiple books.  
- Use loops for adding and displaying books.  
- Include a search feature that matches user input with book titles.

### **Homework 2: Student Grades Management (OOP, Loops, Arrays)**  
**Task:**  
Create a program to manage student grades. The program should allow the user to:  
1. Add students and their grades for three subjects (Math, Science, English).  
2. Calculate and display the average grade for each student.  
3. Determine the student with the highest average grade.  

**Requirements:**  
- Use a class `Student` with the following attributes:  
  - Name  
  - Grades for three subjects  
  - Average grade  

- Implement the following methods in the `Student` class:  
  - A method to calculate the average grade.  
  - A method to display student details.  

- Use an array of `Student` objects to handle multiple students.  
- Use loops to iterate through the array for calculations.
