## Homework 1 (Alternative): Grocery Store Billing System (Structures, Loops, Arrays)
# Task:


*Create a program to simulate a simple billing system for a grocery store. The program should:*
*
Allow the user to add up to 50 items available in the store, with details such as:
Item Name
Price per Unit
Quantity in Stock
Display the list of available items.
Allow a customer to create a bill by purchasing items, where they specify:
Item Name
Quantity to purchase
Calculate the total bill and update the stock quantities accordingly.
Prevent the purchase if the requested quantity exceeds the stock.
Requirements:

Use a struct to represent each item in the store.
Use an array to store multiple items.
Use loops for adding items, generating the bill, and updating stock.
Include input validation to ensure the user cannot purchase more than what is available.
